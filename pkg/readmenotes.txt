ln 14 - it's not entirely clear to me if the new sentence is talking about a different feature, or
if it is clarifying the first sentence. If the first, I would do something like: "...pages in memory,
as well as simple read and write methods", etc. If the second, maybe "...pages in memory via simple
read and write methods..."
